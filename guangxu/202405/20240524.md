## Algorithm

[114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list)

### Description

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.


Example 1:

![](assets/20240524-18f6c85b.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100


Follow up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?

### Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        while(root!=null){
            if(root.left!=null){
                TreeNode cur = root.left;
                while(cur.right!=null){
                    cur = cur.right;
                }
                cur.right = root.right;
                root.right = root.left;
                root.left = null;
            }
            root = root.right;
        }
    }
}
```
