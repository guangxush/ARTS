[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

### Description

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices==null||prices.length==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int local = prices[0];
        int global = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            local = Math.min(prices[i], local);
            global = Math.max(global, prices[i]-local);
        }
        return global;
    }
}
```
