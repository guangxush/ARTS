## Algorithm

[344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

### Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.



Example 1:

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

### Solution


```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int i=0, j=s.length-1;
        while(i<s.length/2){
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i++] = s[j];
            s[j--] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseString(String s) {
       return new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
