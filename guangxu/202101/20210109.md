## Algorithm

[1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

### Description

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


If there is no common subsequence, return 0.


Example 1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```


Example 2:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```


Example 3:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
- 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int a = text1.length();
        int b = text2.length();

        int[][] dp = new int[a+1][b+1];
        for(int i=1;i<=a;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=b;j++){
                char c1 = text1.charAt(i - 1);
				char c2 = text2.charAt(j - 1);
                if(c1==c2){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[a][b];
    }
}
```
