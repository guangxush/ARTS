## Algorithm

[162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

### Description

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
- nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length-1;
        while(low<high){
            int mid1 = (low+high)/2;
            int mid2 = mid1+1;
            if(nums[mid1] < nums[mid2]){
                low = mid2;
            }else{
                high = mid1;
            }    
        }
        return low;
    }
}
```
