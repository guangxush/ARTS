## Algorithm

[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence)

### Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 100
- 0 <= t.length <= 104
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.


Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?


### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(i<s.length() && j<t.length()){
            if(s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i==s.length();
    }
}

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int length1 = s.length(); int length2 = t.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[length1+1][length2+1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= length1; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= length2; j++){
                if(s.charAt(i-1) == t.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        if(dp[length1][length2] == length1){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
