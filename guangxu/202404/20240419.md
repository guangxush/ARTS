## Algorithm

[474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)

### Description

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.

A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

Example 1:

```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {"0001", "1"} and {"10", "1", "0"}.
{"111001"} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 600
- 1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
- 1 <= m, n <= 100

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {
        //dp[i][j]表示i个0和j个1时的最大子集
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        int oneNum, zeroNum;
        for (String str : strs) {
            oneNum = 0;
            zeroNum = 0;
            for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
                if (ch == '0') {
                    zeroNum++;
                } else {
                    oneNum++;
                }
            }
            //倒序遍历
            for (int i = m; i >= zeroNum; i--) {
                for (int j = n; j >= oneNum; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeroNum][j - oneNum] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
