[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

### Description

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example 1:

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= points.length <= 105
- points[i].length == 2
- -231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        // 根据气球直径的开始坐标从小到大排序
        // 使用Integer内置比较方法，不会溢出
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int count = 1;  // points 不为空至少需要一支箭
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > points[i - 1][1]) {  // 气球i和气球i-1不挨着，注意这里不是>=
                count++; // 需要一支箭
            } else {  // 气球i和气球i-1挨着
                points[i][1] = Math.min(points[i][1], points[i - 1][1]); // 更新重叠气球最小右边界
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
