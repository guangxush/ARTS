[1049. Last Stone Weight II](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)

### Description

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

Example 1:

```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
- 1 <= stones[i] <= 100

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
       int sum = 0;
        for (int i : stones) {
            sum += i;
        }
        int target = sum >> 1;
        //初始化dp数组
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.length; i++) {
            //采用倒序
            for (int j = target; j >= stones[i]; j--) {
                //两种情况，要么放，要么不放
                dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - stones[i]] + stones[i]);
            }
        }
        return sum - 2 * dp[target];
    }
}
```
