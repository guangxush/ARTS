## Algorithm

[172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)

### Description

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note that n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.


Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 104
- Follow up: Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(n>0) {
        	count += n/5;
        	n = n/5;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
