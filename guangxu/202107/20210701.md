[151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

### Description

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


Example 1:

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

Example 4:

```
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
```

Example 5:

```
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
        String temp = "";
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            if(s.charAt(i)==' '&&temp.length()!=0){
                stack.push(temp);
                temp = "";
            }else if(s.charAt(i)!=' '){
                temp += s.charAt(i);
            }
            if(i==s.length()-1){
                stack.push(temp.trim());
            }
        }
        String result = "";
        while(!stack.isEmpty()){
            result += stack.pop();
            result += " ";
        }
        return result.strip();
    }
}
```
