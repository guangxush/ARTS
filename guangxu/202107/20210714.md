[528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

### Description

You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1]. pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. For example, for w = [1, 3], the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).


Example 1:

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.
```

Example 2:

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= w.length <= 10000
- 1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
- pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {

    Random random;
    int[] wSums;

    public Solution(int[] w) {
        this.random = new Random();
        for(int i=1; i<w.length; ++i)
            w[i] += w[i-1];
        this.wSums = w;
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = wSums.length;
        int idx = random.nextInt(wSums[len-1]) + 1;
        int left = 0, right = len - 1;
        // search position
        while(left < right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(wSums[mid] == idx)
                return mid;
            else if(wSums[mid] < idx)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
