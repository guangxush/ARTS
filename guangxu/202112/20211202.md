## Algorithm

[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

### Description

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 < nums[i], target < 104
- All the integers in nums are unique.
- nums is sorted in ascending order.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length-1;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = (low + high)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > target){
                high = mid -1;
            }else if(nums[mid] < target){
                low = mid + 1;
            }else{
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
