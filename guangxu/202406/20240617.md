[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Description

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
        while(left < right){
            int w = right - left;
            int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = h * w;
            max = Math.max(max, area);
            if(height[left] < height[right]) left++;
            else if(height[left] > height[right]) right--;
            else {
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
