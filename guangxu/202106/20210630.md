## Algorithm

[135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

### Description

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.


Example 1:

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

Constraints:

- n == ratings.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

### Solution

```java
public int candy(int[] ratings) {
    int candies[] = new int[ratings.length];        
    Arrays.fill(candies, 1);// Give each child 1 candy

    for (int i = 1; i < candies.length; i++){// Scan from left to right, to make sure right higher rated child gets 1 more candy than left lower rated child
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) candies[i] = (candies[i - 1] + 1);
    }

    for (int i = candies.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {// Scan from right to left, to make sure left higher rated child gets 1 more candy than right lower rated child
	    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], (candies[i + 1] + 1));
    }

    int sum = 0;        
    for (int candy : candies)  
    	sum += candy;        
    return sum;
}
```
