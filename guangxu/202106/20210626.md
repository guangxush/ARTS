## Algorithm

[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

### Description

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Example 1:

![](assets/20210626-53b575b6.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int max_area = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++)
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++)
                if(grid[i][j] == 1)max_area = Math.max(max_area, AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j));
        return max_area;
    }

    public int AreaOfIsland(int[][] grid, int i, int j){
        if( i >= 0 && i < grid.length && j >= 0 && j < grid[0].length && grid[i][j] == 1){
            grid[i][j] = 0;
            return 1 + AreaOfIsland(grid, i+1, j) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i-1, j) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j-1) + AreaOfIsland(grid, i, j+1);
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
