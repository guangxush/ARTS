## Algorithm

[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

### Description

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

Example 4:

```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left=0,right=height.length-1;
        int maxArea= 0;
        while(left<right){
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, (right-left)*Math.min(height[left],height[right]));
            if(height[left]>height[right]){
                right--;
            }else{
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
