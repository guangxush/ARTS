## Algorithm

[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

### Description

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

![](assets/20240807-089400cb.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100


Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

### Solution
