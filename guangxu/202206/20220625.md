[235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

### Description

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


Example 1:

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -109 <= Node.val <= 109
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the BST.

### Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root.val > p.val && root.val > q.val){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        }else if(root.val < p.val && root.val < q.val){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        }else{
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```
