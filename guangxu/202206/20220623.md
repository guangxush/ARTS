[1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

### Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.


Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
- The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

Note: This question is the same as 865: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

### Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int deepest = 0;
    TreeNode lca;

    public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root, 0);
        return lca;
    }

    private int helper(TreeNode node, int depth) {
        deepest = Math.max(deepest, depth);
        if (node == null) {
            return depth;
        }
        int left = helper(node.left, depth + 1);
        int right = helper(node.right, depth + 1);
        if (left == deepest && right == deepest) {
            lca = node;
        }
        return Math.max(left, right);
    }
}
```
