[123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

### Description

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 105

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length==0){
            return 0;
        }
        int b1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int b2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int p1=0, p2=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            // 最低价格 = 找出最低的价格
            b1 = Math.min(b1,prices[i]);
            // 最大收益 = 当前价格-最低的价格
            p1 = Math.max(p1,prices[i]-b1);
            // 当前价格-以往最高的收益
            b2 = Math.min(b2,prices[i]-p1);
            // 当前价格 + 以往最高收益
            p2 = Math.max(p2,prices[i]-b2);
        }
        return p2;
    }
}
```


```Java
public int MaxProfitDpCompact1(int[] prices) {
    if (prices.Length == 0) return 0;
    var dp = new int[3, prices.Length];
    for (int k = 1; k <= 2; k++) {
        int min = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.Length; i++) {
            min = Math.Min(min, prices[i] - dp[k-1, i-1]);
            dp[k, i] = Math.Max(dp[k, i-1], prices[i] - min);
        }
    }

    return dp[2, prices.Length - 1];
}
```
