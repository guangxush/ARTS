## Algorithm

[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description)

### Description

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Example 1:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= m, n <= 100

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        dp[1][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[i][1] = dp[i - 1][1];
        }
        for (int j = 2; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[1][j] = dp[1][j - 1];
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 2; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```
