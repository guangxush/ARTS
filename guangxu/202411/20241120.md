[438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

### Description

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
- s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(s==null||p==null) return result;
        int left =0,right =0,count =p.length();
        int[] map = new int[256];
        char[] sc = s.toCharArray();
        for(char c:p.toCharArray()) map[c]++;
        while(right<s.length()) {
        	if(map[sc[right++]]-->=1)count--;
        	if(count==0)result.add(left);
        	if(right-left==p.length()&&map[sc[left++]]++>=0) count++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
