[1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-for-longest-repeated-character-substring/)

### Description

You are given a string text. You can swap two of the characters in the text.

Return the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can swap the first 'b' with the last 'a', or the last 'b' with the first 'a'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa", which its length is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Swap 'b' with the last 'a' (or the first 'a'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa", which its length is 6.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: text = "aaabbaaa"
Output: 4
```

Example 4:

```
Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa", length is 5.
```

Example 5:

```
Input: text = "abcdef"
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= text.length <= 2 * 104
- text consist of lowercase English characters only.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxRepOpt1(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int[] newCount = new int[26];
        for(char c:s.toCharArray()) newCount[c-'a']++;

        // record the character that has maxCount in current window
        // later we use this character to find whether there is a possible
        // character out of window we could swap with.
        char maxChar = 'A';
        int start = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLength = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < len; end++) {
            if(maxCount < ++count[s.charAt(end) - 'a'])
            {
                maxCount = count[s.charAt(end) - 'a'];
                maxChar = s.charAt(end);
            }
            while (end - start + 1 - maxCount > 1 || end - start + 1 > newCount[maxChar -'a']) {
                count[s.charAt(start) - 'a']--;
                start++;
                maxCount=0;
                for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
                    if(maxCount < count[i]){
                        maxCount = count[i];
                    }
                }
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
