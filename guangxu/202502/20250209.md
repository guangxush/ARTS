## Algorithm

[79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

### Description

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.



Example 1:

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- m == board.length
- n = board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 6
- 1 <= word.length <= 15
- board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    /**
	   ALGORITHM
	   STEP 1: loop over all the cells in the board
	   STEP 2: if the cells character is equal to the first letter in word and dfs call is true
				-> return true
	   STEP 3: the word was never found return false
    */
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        for(int i=0;i<board.length;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<board[0].length;j++){
                if(board[i][j] == word.charAt(0) && dfs(board, i, j, word, 0)){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    /*
    Input: char[][] board, int row, int col, String word, int index

    ALGORITHM
        BASE CASE: if index equals the words length
                   -> return true
        BASE CASE: if the row is out of the grid, the col is out of the grid,
				   or the character at row,col does not equal the character in word at index
                    -> return false

        STEP 1: store the current char
        STEP 2: set the current char to ""
        STEP 3: call function in all four valid directions
        STEP 4: set the current char back
        STEP 5: return OR of all four calls

    public boolean dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col, String word, int index){
        if(index == word.length()){

        }

        if(row < 0 || row >= grid.length || col < 0 || col >= grid[row].length
        || grid[row][col] != word.charAt(index)){
            return false;
        }

        char current = word.charAt(index);
        grid[row][col] = ' ';

        return result;
    }
