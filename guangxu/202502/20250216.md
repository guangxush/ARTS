## Algorithm

[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### Description

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- -104 <= target <= 104

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] A, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = A.length - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (A[mid] == target) return mid;

            if (A[low] <= A[mid]) {
                if (target >= A[low] && target < A[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (target > A[mid] && target <= A[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return A[low] == target ? low : -1;
    }
}
```
