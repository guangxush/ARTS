## Algorithm

[268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

### Description

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
       int len = nums.length;
       int sum = (1+len)*len/2;
       int arraySum = 0;
       for(int num : nums){
          arraySum += num;
       }
       return sum - arraySum;
    }
}
```
