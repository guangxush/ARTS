## Algorithm

[451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

### Description

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105
- s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        int [] cnt=new int[123];
        for(char ch:s.toCharArray())
            cnt[ch]++;
        char[] c =new char[s.length()];
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();){
            int max=0;
            int index=0;
            for(int j=0;j<123;j++){
                if(cnt[j]>max){
                    max=cnt[j];
                    index=j;
                }
            }
            while(cnt[index]>0){
                c[i++]=(char)index;
                cnt[index]--;
            }    
        }
        return new String(c);
    }
}
```
