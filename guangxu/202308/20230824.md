## Algorithm

[258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

### Description

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.


Example 1:

```
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= num <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
    }
}
```
