## Algorithm

[75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

### Description

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.



Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        if(len < 2){
            return;
        }

        int left = 0;
        int right = len - 1;
        int current = 0;
        while(current <= right) {
            if(nums[current] == 0){
                swap(nums, left, current);
                left++;
                current++;
            }else if(nums[current] == 1) {
                current++;
            }else {
                swap(nums, right, current);
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j){
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```
