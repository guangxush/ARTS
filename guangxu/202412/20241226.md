## Algorithm

[57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

### Description

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.


Example 1:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
- intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
- newInterval.length == 2
- 0 <= start <= end <= 105

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] insert(int[][] intervals, int[] newInterval) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();

         for(int[] i : intervals){
             if(newInterval == null || i[1] < newInterval[0]){
                 result.add(i);
             }else if(i[0] > newInterval[1]){
                // be carefult the sequence here
                 result.add(newInterval);
                 result.add(i);
                 newInterval = null;
             }else{

                 newInterval[0] = Math.min(newInterval[0], i[0]);//get min
                 newInterval[1] = Math.max(newInterval[1], i[1]);//get max
             }
         }

        if(newInterval != null)
            result.add(newInterval);

        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }
}
```

### Discuss

```
___: current interval(i); _ _ _: newInterval

1) i.end < newInterval.start，then we can safely add i to result;
	newInterval still needs to be compared with latter intervals

	|________|
			       |_ _ _ _ _|

2) i.start > newInterval.end，then we can safely add both to result，
	and mark newInterval as null

			       |________|
	|_ _ _ _ _|

3) There is overlap between i and newInterval. We can merge i into newInterval,
then use the updated newInterval to compare with latter intervals.


	|________|

	|_ _ _ _ _|
