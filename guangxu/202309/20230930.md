[103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

### Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
