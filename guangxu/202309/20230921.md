[1219. Path with Maximum Gold](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/)

### Description

In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.


Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 15
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
- There are at most 25 cells containing gold.

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    int r = 0;
    int c = 0;
    int max = 0;
    public int getMaximumGold(int[][] grid) {
        r = grid.length;
        c = grid[0].length;
        for(int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < c; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] != 0) {
                    dfs(grid, i, j, 0);
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j, int cur) {
        if(i < 0 || i >= r || j < 0 || j >= c || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            max = Math.max(max, cur);
            return;
        }
        int val = grid[i][j];
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j, cur + val);
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j, cur + val);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1, cur + val);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1, cur + val);
        grid[i][j] = val;
    }
}
```
